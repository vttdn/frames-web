  "faq_answer1": "Frames lets you record comprehensive metadata for each analog shot, including camera settings like shutter speed, aperture, focal length, exposure compensation, and flash usage. You can also document your film stock details, brand, and ISO rating.<br><br>GPS location and date/time are automatically captured, with manual override options when needed. Frames organizes everything by roll number, making it easy to track which rolls are shot, developed, or still in your camera.<br><br>Beyond technical data, you can add custom notes about lighting conditions, weather, or creative intentions. This creates a complete archive of your analog photography with all essential information preserved, helping you analyze your technique and improve your film photography skills.",
  "faq_question2": "Does Frames for Mac support common film scanning photo formats?",
  "faq_answer2": "The macOS companion app currently supports JPEG (.jpg) and TIFF (.tiff) files for embedding and exporting EXIF metadata. We're also actively exploring support for additional photo formats such as DNG and NEF, based on real-world workflows and analog shooters demand. Our goal is to build a tool that truly supports the needs of film photography enthusiasts, both in the field and in post-processing.<br><br>If DNG support or other features would make your photography workflow smoother, don’t hesitate to let us know, we’re listening.",
  "faq_question3": "Can I record tripod settings, filters, and accessories in my film notes?",
  "faq_answer3": "For now, the focus is on keeping the app simple and efficient for most analog photographers. But you're not limited: there's a dedicated Notes field where you can jot down extra info like tripod use, filter types, or any other gear-related details.<br><br>These aren’t part of the official EXIF metadata specification, but the Notes field gives you the flexibility to include whatever matters to your film workflow, without cluttering the core interface.",
  "faq_question4": "Will there be an Android version of Frames?",
  "faq_answer4": "An Android version of our film photography app is definitely something we're thinking about, it's on our radar.

  "review7_title": "This app fills the gap between what digital cameras can do and analog cameras cannot.",
  "review7_descr": "Lately, I've been feeling nostalgic about film photography and decided to get back into it. Unlike in the past, we're now in the digital age where it's standard to have shooting information saved as EXIF data. That made me wonder if there was a way to record similar metadata for photos taken on film. After some research, I came across this app. With this app, you can preset your lens, aperture, and shutter speed, and then simply press a button for each shot. It records the settings along with the frame number. It also logs the time and GPS coordinates, so the end result is almost on par with digital cameras.<br><br>The records can be exported as TXT or JSON, and with a simple script using exiftool, you can apply that data to your images without much trouble. By adding the EXIF metadata to JPEGs after converting and editing your film scans on your computer, they end up just like digital photos.<br><br>One limitation is that the app caps the maximum number of frames per roll at 40. Since a 36-exposure roll can produce up to 72 frames on a half-frame camera, having a limit of 80 would be ideal… (I've already sent this feedback to the developer).",
