  "review7_title": "This app fills the gap between what digital cameras can do and analog cameras cannot.",
  "review7_descr": "Lately, I've been feeling nostalgic about film photography and decided to get back into it. Unlike in the past, we're now in the digital age where it's standard to have shooting information saved as EXIF data. That made me wonder if there was a way to record similar metadata for photos taken on film. After some research, I came across this app. With this app, you can preset your lens, aperture, and shutter speed, and then simply press a button for each shot. It records the settings along with the frame number. It also logs the time and GPS coordinates, so the end result is almost on par with digital cameras.<br><br>The records can be exported as TXT or JSON, and with a simple script using exiftool, you can apply that data to your images without much trouble. By adding the EXIF metadata to JPEGs after converting and editing your film scans on your computer, they end up just like digital photos.<br><br>One limitation is that the app caps the maximum number of frames per roll at 40. Since a 36-exposure roll can produce up to 72 frames on a half-frame camera, having a limit of 80 would be ideal… (I've already sent this feedback to the developer).",
