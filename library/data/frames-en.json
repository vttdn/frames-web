Unlike back in the day, now—living in the digital age—it’s totally normal to keep track of your shooting data thanks to EXIF metadata. That got me thinking: is there any way to do something similar for photos taken on film? While looking for an answer, I came across this app. With it, you can set up your lens, aperture, and shutter speed in advance, then tap a button each time you take a shot to save those exact settings by frame number. The app also logs the time and GPS location, which gives you a surprisingly detailed record—almost like what you'd get from a digital camera. Of course, there can sometimes be a small difference between the time on your camera and your iPhone, but honestly, it’s barely noticeable and doesn’t really matter for most uses.",
