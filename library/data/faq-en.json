            "text": "The macOS companion app currently supports JPEG (.jpg) and TIFF (.tiff) files for embedding and exporting EXIF metadata. We're also actively exploring support for additional formats such as DNG and NEF, based on real-world workflows and user demand. Our goal is to build a tool that truly supports the needs of film photography enthusiasts, both in the field and in post-processing.If DNG support or other features would make your workflow smoother, don’t hesitate to let us know, we’re listening."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "For now, the focus is on keeping the app simple and efficient for most analog photographers. But you're not limited — there's a dedicated Notes field where you can jot down extra info like tripod use, filter types, or any other gear-related details.These aren’t part of the official EXIF metadata specification, but the Notes field gives you the flexibility to include whatever matters to your film workflow, without cluttering the core interface."

However, for the time being, our main focus is on making the iPhone and macOS experience as polished, reliable, and complete as possible. We want to ensure that everything works seamlessly and meets the high standards we’ve set.If the iOS version proves successful and continues to resonate with photographers, expanding to Android could very well be next on the roadmap.
