            "text": "At the moment, the macOS companion app supports JPEG (.jpg) files for embedding and exporting EXIF metadata. Support for TIFF (.tif) files is currently under consideration and may be added in the future based on user demand and practical use cases. We're committed to building this tool around the real needs of photographers in the field, so your feedback plays a crucial role in shaping future updates. If TIFF support or other features would make your workflow smoother, don’t hesitate to let us know, we’re listening."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "An Android version is definitely something we're thinking about — it's on our radar. However, for the time being, our main focus is on making the iPhone and macOS experience as polished, reliable, and complete as possible. We want to ensure that everything works seamlessly and meets the high standards we’ve set. If the iOS version proves successful and continues to resonate with users, expanding to Android could very well be next on the roadmap. Stay tuned, and let us know if you’d be interested, your input helps guide what comes next."

            "text": "You can record a complete set of camera settings and metadata for each shot, including the camera brand and model, shutter speed, aperture, focal length, exposure compensation, flash usage, lens details, and film stock. GPS location and date/time are automatically logged, but you can override them manually if needed. You can also add custom notes to include any additional context or details, helping you create a rich, well-organized archive of your film photography with all essential information preserved."
