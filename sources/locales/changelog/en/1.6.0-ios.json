      "content": "Configure which shutter speeds appear in the recorder slider and frame settings on a per-camera basis. If your camera only has speeds from 1/1000 to 1 second, you can hide the extended range options. This keeps your recorder interface clean and prevents accidentally logging speeds your camera doesn't support. Custom sequences sync with the Mac app for consistent metadata across devices."
