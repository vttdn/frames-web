      "content": "After hearing from the analog photography community on Reddit, it became clear that many of you wanted the option to own the app outright rather than subscribe. I get it, there's something reassuring about a one-time purchase that's yours forever. So I've added a lifetime plan that includes all current features and the Mac app. It's yours permanently, no expiration."
