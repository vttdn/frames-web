  "summary": "This update focuses on getting your data out of the app more easily and saving you time when starting new rolls. You can now export entire folders at once, and the app remembers your last settings so you spend less time on setup. The search interface has also been cleaned up, and there are new film stocks to choose from.",

If you tend to shoot the same setup for a while, you can jump straight to recording without re-entering everything. Of course, you can still change any of these settings before you start."
