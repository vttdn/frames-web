The camera includes automatic film loading and DX code reading up to ISO 3200, which means less fiddling with settings. What's interesting is that Analogue Shop started as a camera store in Amsterdam before deciding to design their own camera.

There's a built-in flash you activate by turning the ring around the lens. It's lightweight, pocketable, and dead simple to use. The tradeoff is image quality: the plastic lens produces soft results, especially at distance. It works best with ISO 400 film and subjects about 1.5 to 2 meters away. If you want sharp images or manual control, look elsewhere. But if you want an affordable way to shoot more frames per roll without worrying about settings, the H35 delivers exactly that."

The top and bottom covers are now milled from solid brass instead of die-cast zinc, and they use the same abrasion-resistant black lacquer as the M11. The viewfinder is the improved 0.72x version from the MP with better anti-glare coating. The light meter now includes a red center dot in addition to the arrow symbols to confirm correct exposure, plus a battery warning indicator. Leica kept the “Leitz” red dot logo instead of “Leica” as a nod to the original."

This is the most stripped-down M camera you can buy new: no light meter, no electronics, no battery at all. It's completely mechanical and will work indefinitely without power."
    },

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The M-A uses chromed brass top and bottom covers and deliberately omits the red Leica dot for maximum understatement. It's also noticeably slimmer than digital M cameras. You get shutter speeds up to 1/1000 and the same 0.72x viewfinder as other modern M cameras, with frame lines for 28mm through 135mm lenses. At around $5,000-6,000, it's for photographers who want to focus purely on aperture, shutter speed, and composition without any electronic assistance. Leica even includes a roll of Kodak Tri-X 400 with each camera, acknowledging the pairing of two photographic classics born in the 1950s."

      "content": "Leica introduced the MP in 2003 as their answer to photographers wanting a fully mechanical rangefinder with just a light meter. The name stands for “Mechanical Perfection”, and it sits between the M6 and M-A in terms of features. You get a TTL light meter that requires a battery, but the rest of the camera operates mechanically without power."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The MP borrowed design elements from the classic M3, including a metal film advance lever and rewind knob instead of the M6's crank. The viewfinder has improved anti-flare coatings compared to the M6. It's built from solid brass with either black paint or silver chrome finish, and lacks the red Leica dot for a lower profile. The battery only powers the light meter, so if it dies, the camera still works perfectly. At $6,415, it's priced similarly to the M6 re-edition and appeals to photographers who want mechanical reliability with metering assistance."

One clever touch is the USB-C rechargeable CR2 battery that comes with it, though you can also use standard disposable CR2s. The camera defaults to flash OFF, which is something photographers have been asking for. It includes unlimited multiple exposures and comes with accessories like a Splitzer lens attachment for creative double exposures and colored flash gels.

The top and bottom plates are magnesium alloy (same material used in Pentax's high-end digital cameras like the K-1), which keeps it light but durable.
